```

```



The task here is to load your Danish Monarchs csv into R using the `tidyverse` toolkit, calculate and explore the kings' duration of reign with pipes `%>%` in `dplyr` and plot it over time.

## Load the kings

Make sure to first create an  `.Rproj` workspace with a `data/` folder where you place either your own dataset or the provided `kings.csv` dataset. 

1. Look at the dataset that are you loading and check what its columns are separated by? (hint: open it in plain text editor to see)

List what is the

separator:  ,  

2. Create a `kings` object in R with the different functions below and inspect the different outputs.
-  `read.csv()`
-  `read_csv()`
-  `read.csv2()` 
-  `read_csv2()`
```{r eval=TRUE}
# FILL IN THE CODE BELOW and review the outputs
kings1 <- read.csv("data/danish_kings.csv")
#kings1

kings2 <- read_csv("data/danish_kings.csv", na="NA")
kings2
class(kings2)


kings3 <- read.csv2("data/danish_kings.csv")
#kings3

kings4 <- read_csv2( "data/danish_kings.csv")
#kings4

```

Answer: 
1. Which of these functions is a `tidyverse` function? Read data with it below into a `kings` object

They're all tidyverse functions since they're all in the tidyverse package. However, only read_csv reads the data correctly.



2. What is the result of running `class()` on the `kings` object created with a tidyverse function.

It tells us the class of the object. Specifically, it tells us that 'kings' object is a data frame.



3. How many columns does the object have when created with these different functions?

My dataset has 8 columns with read.csv & read_csv. 1 column with read_csv2 (because it can't read the data correctly)



4. Show the dataset so that we can see how R interprets each column

The glimpse function is used.



```{r eval = TRUE}
# COMPLETE THE BLANKS BELOW WITH YOUR CODE, then turn the 'eval' flag in this chunk to TRUE.

kings <- kings2

class(kings)

ncol(kings)

glimpse(kings)


```


## Calculate the duration of reign for all the kings in your table
You can calculate the duration of reign in years with `mutate` function by subtracting the equivalents of your `startReign` from `endReign` columns and writing the result to a new column called `duration`. But first you need to check a few things:

* Is your data messy? Fix it before re-importing to R
* Do your start and end of reign columns contain NAs? Choose the right strategy to deal with them: `na.omit()`, `na.rm=TRUE`, `!is.na()`


Create a new column called  `duration` in the kings dataset, utilizing the `mutate()` function from tidyverse. Check with your group to brainstorm the options.

```{r}

# A new column for duration is calculated and added to the data frame.

kings <- kings %>% 
  mutate(duration = end_first_reign_year - start_first_reign_year)


```

## Calculate the average duration of reign for all rulers
Do you remember how to calculate an average on a vector object? If not, review the last two lessons and remember that a column is basically a vector. So you need to subset your `kings` dataset to the `duration` column. If you subset it as a vector you can calculate average on it with `mean()` base-R function. If you subset it as a tibble, you can calculate average on it with `summarize()` tidyverse function. Try both ways!

* You first need to know how to select the relevant `duration` column. What are your options?
* Is your selected `duration` column a tibble or a vector? The `mean()` function can only be run on a vector. The `summarize()` function works on a tibble.
* Are you getting an error that there are characters in your column? Coerce your data to numbers with `as.numeric()`.
* Remember to handle NAs: `mean(X, na.rm=TRUE)`


```{r}

# We use two different methods to calculate the average reign duration:

# Subsetting as a vector with mean()
duration1 <- c(kings$end_first_reign_year-kings$start_first_reign_year)
duration1
average_duration <- mean(duration1, na.rm=TRUE)
average_duration

# Subsetting as a tibble with summarize()
kings %>% 
  summarise(duration2 = mean(duration, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  select(duration2)


```

## How many and which kings enjoyed a longer-than-average duration of reign?

You have calculated the average duration above. Use it now to `filter()` the `duration` column in  `kings` dataset. Display the result and also count the resulting rows with `count()`

```{r}

# We create a new 'kings_long' data frame that only includes monarchs with above average reign durations. The count function tells us how many of these there are.

kings_long <-  filter(kings, duration > average_duration)
select(kings_long, monarch_name, duration)
count(kings_long)

```


## How many days did the three longest-ruling monarchs rule? 

* Sort kings by reign `duration` in the descending order. Select the three longest-ruling monarchs with the `slice()` function
* Use `mutate()` to create `Days` column where you calculate the total number of days they ruled
* BONUS: consider the transition year (with 366 days) in your calculation!

```{r}

# We use the slice function to select the highest 3 durations. Note: Christian 9. and Erik af Pommern ruled for the same amount of years, so they're both in third.

# The average year is 365.2425 days long when you also include leap years. (which is what I think Adela is talking about.) 

kings_long %>% 
  slice_max(duration, n=3) %>%
  mutate(days = duration*365.2425) %>% 
  select(monarch_name, duration, days)
  


```


## Challenge: Plot the kings' duration of reign through time

What is the long-term trend in the duration of reign among Danish monarchs? How does it relate to the historical violence trends ? 

* Try to plot the duration of reign column in `ggplot` with `geom_point()` and  `geom_smooth()`
* In order to peg the duration (which is between 1-99) somewhere to the x axis with individual centuries, I recommend creating a new column `midyear` by adding to `startYear` the product of `endYear` minus the `startYear` divided by two (`startYear + (endYear-startYear)/2`).
* Now you can plot the kings dataset, plotting `midyear` along the x axis and `duration` along y axis
* BONUS: add a title, nice axis labels to the plot and make the theme B&W and font bigger to make it nice and legible!

```{r}

# The ggplot is created here:

kings %>%
  mutate(midyear = start_first_reign_year + (end_first_reign_year - start_first_reign_year)/2) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=midyear,y=duration))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth()+
  theme_bw()+
  theme(text = element_text(size = 14))+
  labs(title = "Trend in the duration of reign among Danish monarchs",
         x = "Year",
         y = "Duration of reign")
  


```

And to submit this rmarkdown, knit it into html. But first, clean up the code chunks, adjust the date, rename the author and change the `eval=FALSE` flag to `eval=TRUE` so your script actually generates an output.
Well done!
